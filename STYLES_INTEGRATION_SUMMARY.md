# CSS Integration Summary

## ✅ What's Been Done

Your custom styles from `/d/sso/hr` have been successfully integrated into the Laravel HRMIS application.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created SCSS Variables** 
   - File: `resources/sass/_variables.scss`
   - Defines all color variables used throughout the app
   - Colors are now consistent and easily customizable

2. **Created Custom SCSS**
   - File: `resources/sass/custom.scss`
   - Contains all your custom styles (2,332 lines)
   - Removed duplicate definitions
   - Organized with SCSS nesting for better maintainability
   - Includes all responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

3. **Updated Main SCSS**
   - File: `resources/sass/app.scss`
   - Now imports both Bootstrap and your custom styles
   - Everything compiles into one optimized CSS file

4. **Updated App Layout**
   - File: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
   - Now uses Vite asset pipeline instead of static CSS file
   - Enables hot-reload during development
   - Proper cache-busting in production
